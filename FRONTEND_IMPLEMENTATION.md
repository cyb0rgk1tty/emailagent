---

## Backend Updates

### Database Models

**File:** `backend/models/database.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `relationship()` between Lead and Draft models
- Imported `sqlalchemy.orm.relationship`
- Lead → drafts (one-to-many)
- Draft → lead (many-to-one)

### API Endpoints

**File:** `backend/api/drafts.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `selectinload(Draft.lead)` for eager loading
- Prevents N+1 query issues
- Returns lead data with each draft

**File:** `backend/api/conversations.py` (existing)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/conversations/{id}` - Get conversation
- `GET /api/conversations/lead/{lead_id}` - Get conversation for lead
- `GET /api/conversations/lead/{lead_id}/timeline` - Timeline view
- `GET /api/conversations/sender/{email}` - All conversations for sender

### Schemas

**File:** `backend/models/schemas.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `lead: Optional["LeadExtracted"]` to `DraftResponse`
- Enables returning lead data with drafts
- Proper type hints for IDE support

### CORS Configuration

**File:** `backend/config.py`

**Changes:**
- Added network IP to CORS origins:
  - `http://192.168.50.5:3001` - Frontend
  - `http://192.168.50.5:8001` - Backend
- Fixes cross-origin access issues for LAN deployment

## Database Fixes

### NULL Array Fields

**Issue:** Pydantic validation errors on NULL arrays
**Fix:** Updated all leads and drafts to use empty arrays `{}` instead of NULL

**SQL:**
```sql
-- Drafts
UPDATE drafts
SET flags = '{}', rag_sources = '{}'
WHERE flags IS NULL OR rag_sources IS NULL;

-- Leads
UPDATE leads
SET
  product_type = COALESCE(product_type, '{}'),
  specific_ingredients = COALESCE(specific_ingredients, '{}'),
  delivery_format = COALESCE(delivery_format, '{}'),
  certifications_requested = COALESCE(certifications_requested, '{}'),
  distribution_channel = COALESCE(distribution_channel, '{}'),
  specific_questions = COALESCE(specific_questions, '{}')
WHERE [any field IS NULL];
```

   - Optimistic updates on mutations

2. **Client-Side Filtering**:
   - Search and filters run client-side
   - No API calls on filter changes
   - Instant results

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Modals load on demand
   - Images lazy loaded

4. **Code Splitting**:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CORS Errors**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy
```
**Fix:** Ensure network IP is in `backend/config.py` CORS_ORIGINS

**2. Charts Not Rendering**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```
**Fix:** Check API response format, ensure data arrays exist

**3. Lead Modal Shows No Timeline**
```
No conversation timeline data
```
**Fix:** Ensure lead has `conversation_id`, check conversations API

**4. Drafts Not Loading**
```
Validation error: Input should be a valid list
```
**Fix:** Ensure NULL arrays are converted to `{}` in database

## What We Do

### Core Business Model
Nutricraft Labs helps individuals, startups, and small to medium businesses develop and launch their own supplement line.

**Our Story:**
We come from the supplement manufacturing industry and noticed a significant gap in the market. Traditional manufacturers typically require minimum order quantities of 5000+ units, which leaves individuals, hobbyists, and startups completely underserved. 

As a startup ourselves, we understand firsthand how challenging this is. When you're just starting out, you need to:
- Test your market without massive financial risk
- Validate demand before committing to huge inventory
- Launch with limited capital
- Iterate based on real customer feedback

That's why we built Nutricraft Labs to make supplement manufacturing accessible to everyone, not just large established brands.
